## 5. Quick Start
This section covers everything you should know about HMHero, as well as a tutorial on 
[trying your first command](#54-trying-your-first-command). The special note is the 
[Key Definitions](#52-key-definitions) and [Command Format](#53-command-format) sections, 
which covers essential knowledge to using HMHero's features.


### 5.1 User Interface
When you launch HMHero, HMHero appears on your screen as a Graphical User Interface(GUI). Let's explore the
layout of the different components of HMHero.

HMHero's GUI consists of a single main window consisting of 3 main sections.
1. [Command Input Box](#command-input-box)
2. [Command Output Box](#command-output-box)
3. [Applicant List Box](#applicant-list-box)

The following picture of the main window shows the three components, numbered accordingly:
![components.png](images%2Fcomponents.png)

Besides the main window, HMHero also has the Help Window. It is not part of the main GUI and is only
shown after a [Help Command](#631-receive-help-during-usage-help) is run.

The Help Window looks like the following:

![help_window.png](images%2Fhelp_window.png)

### 5.2 Key Definitions

#### 5.2.1 Applicant

An applicant in HMHero represents an individual that applied for a job at your company. HMHero tracks various
attributes of an applicant. Compulsory attributes would include their name, phone number, address and email.

The following are the attributes stored for each `Applicant`
* Name
* Phone Number
* Address
* Email
* Application Date
* Interview Date
* Notes

Applicants are unique by name and phone number and are Case Sensitive.
This means you cannot add two or more applicants of the same name and phone number.



[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

---

#### 5.2.2 Notes

A note in HMHero serves as a means of labelling the skills of an applicant. These tags
are unique and case-sensitive.

We can tag multiple applicants with the same note and each applicant can have multiple notes. These notes
are optional.

Feel free to make use of notes as you fit to highlight skill-sets of an applicant. Examples of such notes
can include:
* Highlight applicant's:
  * Technical proficiency, e.g. `Python`, `Java`, `Flask`
  * Soft Skills, e.g. `Project Management`, `Event Planning`

HMHero's Notes are unique by name and are case-sensitive. This means you cannot add two or more notes of
the same name.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### 5.2.3 Flags
Flags are delimiters that enable HMHero to distinguish different parameters without ambiguity.

You could put in the corresponding [Placeholder](#524-placeholders) immediately after each flag.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success" role="alert">:bulb: <strong>Tip:</strong> <br>

### 5.3 Command Format
You will encounter HMHero commands throughout this User Guide.
Before you delve into the different commands in Commands, let’s learn what a command consists of.

Here is an example:
![CommandExample.png](images%2FCommandExample.png)
A command consists of:
Command Word: Tells HMHero what action you wish to execute. These actions are covered in [Commands](#6-commands).<br>
[Flags](#523-flags): Distinguishes between inputs. A flag is usually followed by a placeholder.<br>
[Placeholders](#524-placeholders): Represents data that you wish to input. Replace this with valid data.<br>
For example, `NAME` in `n/NAME` can be replaced with `n/John`.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### 5.4 Trying your First Command

To let you become more familiar with HMHero, let's practise executing some commands.

To start off, let's try out the `add` command! This command lets you add an [applicant](#521-applicant) to HMHero.

One of the available commands in HMHero is the command to create a new applicant.

**Format:** `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [note/NOTE]`
<br>
<br>

**What does the format mean?**
* `add` tells HMHero that this is the command to create a new applicant
* [Flags](#523-flags) such as `n/` and `p/` are delimiters that enable HMHero to distinguish different
parameters supplied by you without ambiguity
* [Placeholders](#524-placeholders) such as `NAME` and `PHONE` shows you what you should place in each portion of the 
command

Notice that there is a pair of square brackets `[]` surrounding some parameters like `note/NOTE`
in the format. This indicates that the parameter is **optional**. Each of these placeholders in the parameters 
have a default value based on the commands. These are documented in the [Commands](#6-commands) section for each command.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> <br>
The <a href="#524-placeholders">Placeholder</a> section covers the restrictions for respective placeholders. For example, 
the date format of PHONE, certain characters you cannot use and the limit and precision of numbers. 
</div>

**Let's try an example!**

Suppose you just add Thomas, 91918153, thomas@gmail.com, living at 6 Sims Drive (s)543230, and you do not
feel the need to record a note for this applicant.

`NAME`: Thomas

`PHONE`: 91918153

`EMAIL`: thomas@gmail.com

`ADDRESS`: 6 Sims Drive (s)543230

The command you would like to enter into the command box would be:

```
add n/Thomas p/91918153 e/thomas@gmail.com a/6 Sims Drive (s)543230
```
<br>

Alternatively, executing these would do the same thing:

* `add n/Thomas e/thomas@gmail.com p/91918153 a/6 Sims Drive (s)543230`

  This is because the order of the flags does not matter.
<br> <br>

* `add n/Thomas p/91918153 e/thomas@gmail.com n/Sally p/97833468 a/6 Sims Drive (s)543230`

    In this case, the name "Thomas" will be overridden by "Sally", and the phone "91918153" 
will be overridden by "97833468".
<br> <br>

However, note that the following executions are invalid:

* `add n/Thomasp/91918153e/thomas@gmail.coma/6 Sims Drive (s)543230`

  There must be spacings between the placeholders and flags.

* `add n/ThomaŚ p/91918153 e/thomas@gmail.com a/6 Sims Drivè (s)543230`

  The restrictions of placeholders are not followed.

* `add`

  There is insufficient information provided; you must minimally provide a name.

Find out more about restrictions in the sections [Flags](#523-flags), [Placeholders](#524-placeholders) 
and [Commands](#6-commands).

---


Let's try out another command -- the `list` command! `list` lets you see the list of the applicants.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">:exclamation: <strong>Caution:</strong> <br>
The format for different commands are not always identical. For example, executing the `add` command and the `list` 
command will have different formats! 
</div>

For example, after adding an applicant, you decided to see the list of applicant.

**Format:** `list`

The command you would like to enter into the [Command Input Box](#51-user-interface) would be:

```
list
```

You should now have a better understanding of how commands are formatted and used. All commands are consolidated
in the [Command Summary](#7-command-summary).

Here is a checklist you can use before running a command:

* [ ] I know the restrictions of the command
* [ ] I know what parameters are supplied to the command
* [ ] I know the flags for each parameter to be supplied
* [ ] I know the restrictions of each parameter
* [ ] I know the effects of not specifying each optional flag.

## 6. Commands

This section shares with you on how to use each command in detail.

Before continuing, ensure you have read the section on [Flags](#523-flags) and [Placeholders](#524-placeholders).

What you should expect to find:

* A description of the command
* The format of the command
* The expected behaviour of the command
* A few valid and invalid examples of the command
* Important points to note


<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> <br>
<ul>
<li> For each command, "Format" indicates the syntax of the command.</li>
    <li>Square brackets indicates an optional parameter.</li>
    <li>In most commands, if the same parameter is repeated and only one is required, we take the last value provided.
</li> 
</ul>
</div>

### 6.1 Applicant Commands

#### 6.1.1 Create a new applicant `add`

**Format**: `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [note/NOTE]`

#### 6.1.2 Search for an applicant `find`

**Format**: `find n/[KEY] p/[KEY] note/[KEY]`

> Finds all applicants in HMHero using name, phone, note or all

**Info**
* The notation `[KEY]...` means that we take in name or phone or note or all.
  In this case, at least one `KEY` is required.
* The `n/[KEY]` and `note/[KEY]` are case-insensitive. (e.g. "apples" will match "Apples").
* The result will be applicants where each of the `KEY` are present in the `NAME` or `PHONE` or `NOTE`.
  (e.g. "Thomas" will only match "Thomas", "91918153" will only match "91918153", "java" will only match "java")


<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">:bulb: <strong>Tip:</strong> <br>
<ul>
    <li> You can use the <a href="#613-list-all-applicants-list">List Command</a> in the next section to display all applicants again!</li> 
</ul> </div>

## 8. Troubleshooting

**Problem:**

The JAR file not launching even after double-clicking the file.

**Solution:**

1. Open your terminal
* Windows:
    * The default key combination to launch your terminal is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>
* Mac:
    * Use <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> to open Spotlight Search
    * Search for "terminal" and click it to launch. 
2. Navigate to the location where "hmhero.jar" is stored within your terminal using `cd`. For example, `cd Downloads/`


3. On your terminal, run `java -jar hmhero.jar`

**Problem:**

The JAR file not launching in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">:information_source: **Note:** 
WSL does not support GUI applications by default. 
</div>

**Solution:**

1. Our recommendation is to run HMHero application on Windows and not on WSL.

**Problem:**

Unable to exit/save HMHero to data file

**Solution:**

1. This error is due to `hmhero.jar` being started in a protected folder. (Examples of write-protected folders include`C:\WINDOWS\System32` in windows and the `/etc` dir in linux) <br> Please move the `hmhero.jar` file into another folder in your computer and start HMHero application from that folder.

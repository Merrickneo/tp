## **Introduction to HMHero**

HMHero is an Applicant Managing System designed to be used by human resource professionals, hiring managers, 
and recruiters who want to streamline the recruitment process and make it more efficient, 
helping their organizations manage job applications and hiring processes more effectively.

This Developer Guide is a detailed documentation on HMHero's design and implementation, describing the architecture, 
an outline of all parts of HMHero and how they work together, and specifications on
feature implementation and considerations.

This guide is intended to assist developers in maintaining, upgrading or evolving HMHero.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **How to use this Developer Guide**

#### Person in place of Applicant

In this Developer Guide, `Person` is used in place of Applicant. Take note that when mentioning `Person`, we are
always talking about an Applicant in HMHero.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.1.1</b> Architecture diagram for high-design of the App
</div>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): Manage the HMHero application User Interface
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): Manage the execution of commands.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from and writes data to the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete n/Alex p/91234567`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.1.2</b> Sequence Diagram for the command <code>delete n/Alex p/91234567</code>
</div>
<br>


Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name} Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.1.3</b> Class Diagram for Component Managers
</div>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.2.1</b> Class Diagram for UI Components
</div>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)
=======
The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. 

Steps to start making changes to the UI:
1. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the [`src/main/resources/view`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view) folder.
2. The managing classes of these UI parts are defined in matching `.java` files in the [`src/main/java/seedu/address/ui`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui) folder.
3. The stylesheets for these UI parts can be found in `Extensions.css`, `HMHero.css`, and `Mainwindow.css`, except `UserProfilePanel` and `HelpWindow` with separate CSS files in matching `.css` files in the [`src/main/resources/view`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view) folder.
4. For instance, the layout of the `HelpWindow` is specified in [`HelpWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/HelpWindow.fxml) with managing class at [`HelpWindow.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindow.java) and CSS file at [`HelpWindow.css`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/HelpWindow.css).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.3.1</b> Class diagram for Logic Components
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `HMHeroParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete n/John p/91234567")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete n/John p/91234567` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.3.2</b> Sequence Diagram for the command <code>delete n/Alex p/91234567</code>
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.3.3</b> Class diagram for Parser Components
</div>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `HMHero` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `HMHeroParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.4.1</b> Class diagram for Model Component
</div>

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Note` list in the `HMHero`, which `Person` references. This allows `HMHero` to only require one `Note` object per unique note, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Note` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.4.2</b> Class diagram for Model Components
</div>

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.5.1</b> Class diagram for Storage Components
</div>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `HMHeroStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

#### Adding an Applicant

#### Overview

The `add` command creates a new `Person`, which represents an Applicant in HMHero's Applicant Managing System.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

:information_source: <strong>Command Format:<strong> 
`add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [applied/APPLIEDDATETIME] [note/NOTE]...` <br>
Refer to [Glossary](#glossary) for more information on Command format.
</div>

The activity diagram is as such:

![AddCommand activity diagram](images/AddApplicantActivityDiagram.png)

#### Feature Details

1. The user specifies Applicants details to create. Compulsory fields are name, phone, address, and email. Optional
fields include application date time and notes about the applicant.
1. If any of the compulsory fields are not provided, or the provided inputs are in the wrong format, an error message
   will be displayed. The user will be prompted to enter the command correctly via the error message.
1. All applicants added will start at the Applied Status.
1. If application date time was not provided, HMHero would assume the application date time of the Applicant to be now
   (the current time on the user's computer)
1. The applicant is cross-referenced in the `Model` to check if it already exists. If it does, an error is raised
to inform the user.
1. If step 5 completes without any exceptions, the new `Person` is created and stored inside HMHero.

#### Feature Considerations

When checking for duplicates in the `UniquePersonList` inside `Model`, any `Person` cannot have the same name and phone
as another. While it is unlikely applicants have the same full name, it is still possible in reality. However, it is 
impossible for unique applicants to share the same number. Thus, HMHero checks name and phone number when checking for
duplicates.

When implementing this feature, we restricted users to only add applicants into the `APPLIED` status. This is because
we wanted HMHero to adhere to the flow of the hiring process. Allowing users to add applicants into specific statuses
could introduce confusion to how `add` command is used.


#### Advancing an Applicant

##### Overview

The `advance` command advances an `Person` in HMHero, which advances the `status` of a `Person`.

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

:information_source: <strong>Command Format:<strong>
`advance n/NAME p/PHONE [d/INTERVIEWDATETIME]` <br>
Refer to [Glossary](#glossary) for more information on Command format and applicant status.
</div>

The activity diagram is as such:

![Advance activity diagram](diagrams/AdvanceActivityDiagram.puml)

>>>>>>> dde2fe9b38fe64cd8aeacb3aa5684dfb3c4af2ee
Here is the activity diagram showing the process of the `advance` command:
![Advance activity diagram](images/AdvanceActivityDiagram.png)

##### Feature Details
1. The user specifies an applicant name and phone that represents a `Person` to be advanced.
2. If the name and phone is not provided, an error is thrown and the user is prompted to 
enter the command correctly via an error message.
3. The name and phone are cross-referenced in the `Model` to check if 
an applicant with the corresponding name and phone exists. If it does not, then an error is raised to inform the user.
4. The status must be either Applied or Shortlisted. Else, then an error is raised to inform the user.
5. If the interview datetime is not provided when the status is Applied, the user will be prompted to enter the command
correctly via an error message.
6. If the interview datetime provided exists in the `Model`, the user will be prompted to enter the command
correctly via an error message.
7. If the interview datetime is provided when the status is Shortlisted, the user will be prompted to enter the command
correctly via an error message.
8. If step 7 is reached without any error message, HMHero advances the specified `Person`'s `status`.

##### Feature Considerations

When implementing this feature, we realised that we could model HMHero to track hiring process in the real world 
more effectively by enforcing the rule that the user can only advance applicants one stage at a time. 
We thus decided to provide a default behaviour when advancing an applicant's status.


#### Rejecting an Applicant

##### Overview

The `reject` command rejects a `Person` in HMHero, which changes the `status` of a `Person` to `REJECTED`.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Here is the activity diagram showing the process of the `reject` command:
![RejectApplicantActivityDiagram](images/RejectApplicantActivityDiagram.png)
=======
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

:information_source: <strong>Command Format:<strong>
`reject n/NAME p/PHONE` <br>
Refer to [Glossary](#glossary) for more information on Command format.
</div>

The activity diagram is as such:
[Add in later]()

Here is the activity diagram showing the process of the `reject` command:
[Add in later]()
>>>>>>> dde2fe9b38fe64cd8aeacb3aa5684dfb3c4af2ee

##### Feature Details
1. The user specifies an applicant name and phone that represents an `Person` to be rejected.
2. If the name and phone is not provided, an error is thrown and the user is prompted to
enter the command correctly via an error message.
3. The name and phone are cross-referenced in the `Model` to check if
    an applicant with the corresponding name and phone exists.
    If it does not, then an error is raised to inform the user.
4. HMHero confirms that the applicant's status is not already `REJECTED`. Else, an error is raised to inform the user.
5. If step 4 completes without any exceptions, then the `Person` is successfully rejected.

##### Feature Considerations

It is feasible to implement the reject feature to successfully executes when `reject` command executes on 
applicants with `REJECTED` status. However, an absence of the error message provides little value to the user and 
may present confusingly to the user. <br>
Additionally, we realised that it is common for hiring managers to reject applicants without removing them. Thus, the
`reject` command does not perform the same functionality as the `delete` command.

#### Finding an Applicant

#### Overview

The `find` command filters applicants based on fields specified by the user. 
Fields have to be denoted by flags. Allowed fields for filtering are `name` and `phone`.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Here is the activity diagram showing the process of the `find` command:
=======
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

:information_source: <strong>Command Format:<strong>
`find [n/NAME] [p/PHONE]` <br>
Refer to [Glossary](#glossary) for more information on Command format.
</div>


The activity diagram is as such:
>>>>>>> dde2fe9b38fe64cd8aeacb3aa5684dfb3c4af2ee

![FindCommandActivityDiagram](images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Feature Details
1. The user specifies one or more fields to filter through the applicant list.
2. If the user specifies more than one field, the filtered applicant list has to match all fields.
3. If the user specifies a field more than once, only the last argument is considered when filtering applicants.

#### Feature considerations
The UI displays a `FilteredList` obtained from an immutable applicant list.
The `FindCommandParser` creates the `Predicate` used to filter the applicant list. When the `FindCommand` is executed,
the `FilteredList` sets its `Predicate` field to the created `Predicate`. The UI shows the new `FilteredList`.

Applicant fields are required as an input as it is helpful to reduce user confusion 
and facilitate finding applicants based on multiple fields.


#### Editing an Applicant

##### Overview

The `edit` feature edits the attached attributes of a specified `Person`,which is specified by the 
one-indexed `personList` presented to the user.

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

:information_source: <strong>Command Format:<strong>
`edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [d/INTERVIEWDATETIME] [note/NOTE]...` <br>
Refer to [Glossary](#glossary) for more information on Command format.
</div>

The activity diagram is as such:
[add in later]()

>>>>>>> dde2fe9b38fe64cd8aeacb3aa5684dfb3c4af2ee
Here is the activity diagram showing the process of the `edit` command:
[EditApplicantActivityDiagram]()


##### Feature Details

1. The user can perform commands that modify the shown applicant list. (Eg. `find` and `interview` commands)
2. The user specifies an index that represents a `Person` to be edited.
3. If a non-zero unsigned integer index is not provided, an error is thrown and the user is prompted 
    to enter the command correctly via an error message.
4. At least one field to be edited has to be provided. Else, the user will be prompted to enter the 
command correctly via an error message.
5. If an index that is not in the valid range of the list is provided, an error is thrown 
    and the user is prompted to enter the command correctly via an error message.
6. The `edit` command creates a new applicant based on the given fields. The created applicant is cross-referenced 
    in the `Model` to check if it already exists. If it already does, then an error is raised to inform the user.
7. If step 6 completes without any exceptions, then the `Person` at the specified index is successfully edited.

##### Feature Considerations

Similar to the `new` command, it should be noted that when checking for duplicates in the `UniquePersonList` inside the 
`Model`, Applicants cannot have the same name and phone number. For example, if a `Person` with the name `Thomas` and 
`91823452` already exists inside the list, then you cannot edit an existing `Person` to have the name `Thomas` and 
`91823452`.

When providing multiple arguments with the same delimiter, 
the last instance of the repeat delimiter is taken during the `parse` command.


#### Displaying the list

##### Overview
The `list` command displays the full list by HMHero.

Here is the activity diagram showing the process of the `list` command:

![ListActivityDiagram](images/ListActivityDiagram.png)

##### Feature Details

1. The user calls the `list` command.
1. HMHero performs the necessary calculations to obtain the statistics. HMHero displays the result to the user.

##### Feature Considerations

The five statistics were chosen as a baseline, and they are a good starting point for users to help 
track the number of applicants. For example, the user can obtain the total number of applicants, and also provide 
the total numbers of applicants for each status.

#### Showing all shortlisted applicants

##### Overview
The `interview` command displays the list of all shortlisted applicants, sorted by earliest interview date.

##### Feature Details
1. The user calls the `interview` command.
2. The applicant list is filtered for shortlisted applicants.
3. The resulting filtered applicant list is sorted by interview date, from earliest to latest.
4. HMHero displays the resulting `SortedList` to the user.
